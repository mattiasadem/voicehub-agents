## HOT PROSPECT 1: Pest Control Company
**Source:** Reddit r/smallbusiness
**Signal:** Hot — paying $500-1000/month, quality issues, no scheduling
**Pain:** Current call service gives wrong info, can't book appointments

---
**Subject:** Quick question about your pest control company's after-hours calls

Hi there,

Saw your post about paying $500-1000/month for a call service that gives wrong info and can't schedule appointments. That's frustrating — inaccurate info plus no booking means lost bookings either way.

Quick fix: VoiceHub answers 100% of calls, qualifies leads, and books appointments directly into your calendar — no misinformation, no missed calls.

Would a 10-minute call this week make sense? I can show you how other pest control companies capture after-hours leads automatically.

Best,

## HOT PROSPECT 2: Nail Salon Owner
**Source:** Reddit r/smallbusiness
**Signal:** Hot — actively seeking receptionist bot for booking
**Pain:** Manual pen/paper scheduling, wants automation

---
**Subject:** Pen/paper to automatic booking — for nail salons

Hi,

Saw you mentioned needing a receptionist bot for appointment booking. Manual scheduling eats time you could spend with clients.

VoiceHub books clients 24/7, answers "do you have Saturday slots?" automatically, and syncs with your calendar. No more phone tag.

One salon owner said they cut callbacks by 80% in the first month.

Worth a 5-minute chat?

## HOT PROSPECT 3: Small Business (blackboardclients)
**Source:** Reddit r/smallbusiness
**Signal:** Hot — "can't afford full-time receptionist", overwhelmed
**Pain:** Too many calls, can't afford FTE, needs cheaper solution

---
**Subject:** Cheaper than a receptionist — but answers every call

Hi,

Your post about incoming calls "killing you" resonated. Missing sales because you can't afford $3k+/month for a receptionist.

VoiceHub costs a fraction, answers every call, books appointments, and never calls in sick. Designed exactly for small businesses that are too busy to answer but can't justify full-time staff.

Most customers break even on day 1 (one booked appointment covers the cost).
