# Ghost-9 LinkedIn Draft — 2026-02-14

## Post

**Hook:** Most SMEs lose 62% of after-hours calls to voicemail. That's not a statistic—that's revenue walking away.

**Body:**

I just published a breakdown on why after-hours calls disappear—and what actually works to capture them.

3 patterns from 50+ SME conversations:

→ "We'll call you back Monday" = customer calls competitor on Sunday
→ Voicemail as filter = only angry customers leave messages
→ After-hours = highest buying intent (they're calling while doing research)

The companies winning here aren't hiring night staff.

They're using voice AI that books qualified leads automatically—even at 11 PM.

If you're still routing calls to voicemail after 6 PM, you're not "closed." You're filtering for competitors.

Full breakdown with the 62% stat and the fix: [link]

**CTA:** What's your after-hours capture rate? Most don't track. The ones measuring are already fixing it.
